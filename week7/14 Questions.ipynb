Please, write a code to check if there is a file 'myfile.txt' in the folder that includes your script (that is it should be one directory away from your current working directory; use .. to specify path). In addition, explroe three different options for opening file r+/w+/a+ and check, which works when there is no file exising in a folder. "

Imagine you are using some functionality a lot (such as printing the name of a function while debugging or checking the execution time) for many different functions. It is time to use decorators. Maybe you want to remind yourself what day of the week it is when you invoke a function; or you want to check how much memory does the function uses. Be creative! "
