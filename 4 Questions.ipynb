Design a font that can be drawn with a minimal number of basic elements and then write functions that draw letters of the alphabet. Pick up 4 (ONLY 4) letters (2 vowels and 2 consonants) to work with. Write one function for each letter, with names draw_a, draw_b, etc. PLEASE DO NOT WRITE CODE FOR ALL ALPHABET LETTERS! ONLY FOUR! You can use alphabeth of any language you like."
